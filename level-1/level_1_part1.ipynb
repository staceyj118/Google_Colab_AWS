A definite must read!

|Sticky Faith Teen Curriculum with DVD: 10 Lessons to Nurture Faith Beyond High School    |Books           |5          |15           |15         |N   |Y                |Helpful and Practical                   |The student curriculum was better than I expected. The lessons were easy to understand and easy to teach. Each lesson has a list up front explaining everything you need for the session. This alone is very helpful.<br /><br />As for the lessons, the students in my Sunday School class (11th and 12th graders) are being challenged by new ideas and thoughts. This has led them to really look at their faith and figure out what they truly believe. This alone is essential to them establishing a personal faith and not cling to the faith of their parents.<br /><br />This curriculum is essential to any youth group. They are topics that should be discussed with every senior before they leave high school.<br /><br />How could you pass up on such a formational curriculum for such a great price?<br /><br />- Zach

    |N   |N                |Paul                                    |I found \\\\\"Black Passenger / Yellow Cabs\\\\\" to be a very readable book.  It was fun going hearing about Mr. Bryan's sexual escapades -- at first.  It was refreshing to have someone who could frequently be very perceptive speak honestly not only about his life, but the sexual escapades and shenanigans he was engaging in.  And to link that behavior with the horrific conditions of his early youth in a ghetto in Jamaica, and more loosely, with the Jamaican cultural socialization which influenced him.  These elements humanized and explained some of his less than noble behavior.<br /><br />However, what becomes extremely obvious as the book goes on (and on and on it does go)is that, even in Mr. Bryan's own words, he suffers from 'dissocial personality disorder,' or some such thing.  Perilously close, it seems to me, to sociopathic behavior.  Even the title, in retrospect, speaks to the sociopaths view of humanity.  Mr. Bryan is a 'passenger', i.e. a person, the woman are 'cabs' -- non-humans.<br /><br />The irony, of course, for anyone who's read the novel is that Mr. Bryan frequently speaks of how the Japanese culture traumatizes and demeans women.  However, he is a flagrant abuser of women -- though he frequently presents himself as the opposite, as one who has nutured these poor women back to health!<br /><br />He has impregnated more than 10 women while in Japan -- and in most case paid or helped to pay for the abortions.  More than 10 women!  All because he enjoys the feel of sex without a condom.  And because he knows that most of the women won't insist that he wear one due to their timidity!  So, in effect, he'd have woman after woman go through the greater trauma of an abortion; and have fetus be terminated (some would even say murdered); and he would even have to pay (in some cases only half) for his temporary pleasure!  This, more than ten times!<br /><br />And let us not forget how he then has his cake and eats it too as he makes out how horrible it is of the Japanese to run an abortion industry, instead of having oral contraceptives more readily available.<br /><br />He also even refers to the women in his writings as cars.  He prefers, he tells the reader, his \\\\\"bentley\\\\\" (Shoko) but the 'ferrari' (Azusa) is sexier and her parents are so accepting of him!<br /><br />The language he uses time and again, in conjunction with the repeated behaviors, indicates that closeness he shares with the sociopath: people are things to be used, manipulated.  People are not people: they are not truly human with feelings and the right to be treated as 'ends in themselves' -- but rather they are trappings, are thigns, to be used and manipulated by the sociopath.<br /><br />Mr. Bryan frequently talks about how he doesn't really love -- indeed, it seems that he doesn't even like very much -- Azusa.  But she's so good looking that he wants to have children with her; while, of course, marrying Shoko (or perhaps converting to Islam -- though he's an atheist -- in the hopes of being able to legally marry both of them).<br /><br />This goes on and on.<br /><br />Again, at first, much of this seemed fun, interesting, a man with hardbreaks coming into his own.  However, this behavior is -- and has been -- going on for years, even into his forites.<br /><br />Yes, there's the 'addiction,' however, I got the distinct impression that Mr. Bryan was being more honest than perhaps he meant to be when he on repeated occasions told the reader about his personality disorder.  He truly has one, it seems.  He may not be a sociopath, but in many respects his 'disorder' is such that other people are things.  For me, to get behind the eyes, so to speak, of a person like that is a frightening experience.  But, pun intended, an 'eye-opener'!<br /><br />It's also curious that Mr. Bryan has, it seems, only female friends.  In part, he would have the reader believe it is because of his greater sensitivity to females and their plight.  He sometimes refers to himself as a 'lesbian in a male's body.'  His sensitivity is hogwash!  Woman form the perfect dovetail for the likes of him:  one, he likes 'tail' and two, he knows that he can manipulate them far more easily than he can men.  These two features make them delectable to him.<br /><br />A minor note.  Much of the book is fairly well written with this curious feature:  there are numerous rather 'lofty' words sprinkled throughout the text.  For example he writes of one woman \\\\\"she tried corybanticly to cloak herself with anything in sight\\\\\" (Yukari; p331).  Now, I have a master's degree in English, but I don't know what the freak \\\\\"corybanticly\\\\\" means.  The point is that too frequently this text is larded with extremely high falutin words, amid, of course, the booty calls, and his petrified rod, etc.<br /><br />Most curious!<br /><br />Anyway, this is in many ways an interesting read: some of the incidents are enjoyable to read; much of the writing is actually pretty good; there are some sharp insights into Japanese culture ( I lived in Japan for a year so I had some access to what he's referring to); there's great awareness generally of culture and its influence (Jamaican, American, Japanese).  There's the fascinating other perspective -- both replusive and fascinating -- of the view from the 'personality disorder'.<br /><br />Anyway, I give this book 3 stars.<br /><br />I hope this review

All in all, it was okay, but it kind of left me wanting more.

        |A must read for science thinkers        |This book is excellent evidence for any conservative who has been wondering why her/his liberal friends (yes this does occur) and family are reluctant to enter into political discussion.  I had been wondering.  As I read this book (borrowed from a neighbor) I learned about beliefs no one in my social milieu had shared with me yet.  I am entirely greatful to learn WHY I am considered incompetent to question national policies.

A further entrant to the popular range of recipe books by the BBC now provides 101 additional cakes and bakes that could add a few kilos or more without trouble to your waistline... and since the recipes look so easy to make as well one cannot rely upon prevarication to help reduce calorific intake.<br />These praiseworthy little books feature the recipe on one side and a full colour photograph on the facing page, put together into a tight little package that gives 101 different dishes for an unbeatable price.<br />Reviewing these books is actually quite hard. One cannot be critical of the approach taken by the entire series as there is nothing that can go wrong (doing a \\\\\"King Alfred\\\\\" not withstanding). . One cannot complain about the breadth of recipes, the price, the appearance, so one might be forced to complain about the sheer tempting nature of the recipes if one has to find something to complain about.<br />Split into six sections - large cakes, fresh fruit cakes, chocolate cakes and bakes, loaf cakes, small cakes and tray bakes and finally muffins and cookies - and backed up by a good little index you can, at-a-glance dig out that favourite recipe, find inspiration based on a particular ingredient or, of course, just browse through and be inspired.<br />Each recipe has even been \\\\\"triple tested\\\\\" by different cooks to ensure that the average home cook will have no problems, something some other cook books could well emulate. So far we have not found a bad book in this series and long may it continue.

smoking has been a typical way of preservation and flavour enhancement since time began, yet it still remains shrouded in mystery and viewed by many to be somehow complex or difficult to do.<br />Yet with a little bit of application, determination and some equipment you can soon have your own \\\\\"home smokery\\\\\" and begin to see for yourself just what a simple difference it can make to both the taste and appearance of food.<br />The author takes care to give the prospective smoker (a phrase one does not hear nowadays without a perforative tone!) a good grounding in exactly what is involved in food smoking and the history behind the art before starting with possibly the most important thing of all: the raw ingredients. Without those you might just have a \\\\\"smokey hole\\\\\".<br />Here the book tends to assume that you might be looking to also kill your own food and prepare it for eventual smoking, but if the nearest you get to a hunt is looking for a good deal at the supermarket you may need to skip a few pages. It remains important, however, to read about the ideal type of ingredients so that you are able to understand exactly what will work well and what will turn out bad.<br />After you have your ingredients at hand - however you acquired them - there is still preparation to do through the brining (salting) process and you are given expert guidance on this important stage as, if you don't do it right, you will only end up disappointed later on.  Ah, but you might not have any smoking equipment! Fear not, as you are helped look at possible equipment purchases to best determine what you might need.  There is a solution for all.<br />Those thinking of setting up a commercial operation can also benefit from this book as, on the whole, it is just a question of scale. Some separate sections on business-related affairs are included but it is also wise to check your country's own specific requirements prior to making any investment for fairly obvious reasons.<br />Hurrah... now it is time to smoke and there are COPIOUS hints, tips and advice about smoking techniques and specific methods for a very wide range of ingredients.  One thing food smokers also like to do is experiment by changing different fire/smoke sources, spicings and the like. Once you have managed the basics you can either stick to that and have a good consistent product or, of course, maybe try something different for a bit of fun and be possibly surprised with the end results.<br />Despite the comparative age of this book and some of the information that might be \\\\\"out of date\\\\\" or \\\\\"not applicable\\\\\" to your locality, the core of this book remains as consistent and relevant today as on the day it was published.  Even if you have not considered smoking your own food but enjoy smoked food, this book will still provide a lot of useful background information to help you understand more about the art of food smoking.<br />It would have been nice to have had some colour illustrations showing the smoking process and, of course, typical end results. A minor niggle but nothing that changes one's opinion of this interesting, knowledgeable and helpful modest tome.it is time to smoke and there are COPIOUS hints, tips and advice about smoking techniques and specific methods for a very wide range of ingredients.

must for tarot readers                |I have been waiting for the release of this book for a while now. I must say that is was worth the wait. It takes you card by card and show you how to connect with each card plus how to interpret it differently for different question. For people who have a hard time relating and interpreting court cards, this book is for you. If you are a beginner or advance this book is for you. It allows you to use your intuition too instead of focusing on old meaning of the cards. It gives you daily meditations and affirmations for each card daily so you can connect well with each card.

can understand that opinion as a good warm apple pie can invoke dreamy memories (and not those that were shown in the \\\\\"American Pie\\\\\" film either!).  Yet the apple is an often under-estimated ingredient in cooking, despite its versatility in both food and drink affairs.<br />This \\\\\"Favourite Apple Recipes\\\\\" book is another in a long series of pocket-sized and friendly books that feature many oft-forgotten, uncommon English recipes, This modest 48 page tome features 34 diverse apple recipes ranging from old favourites such as an apple crumble and apple pudding to more rarified delights such as apple gingerbread, apple and potato cake or even an apple, raisin and cider tea bread.<br />One can surely state that there will be at least a few recipes that you've never heard of, let alone tried before. Yet one does not need to be a kitchen genius to try these recipes, each featured on their own page, as despite the lack of food illustrations one gets sufficient information from the concise, to-the-point instructions.  A very brief history or explanation about the dish's development is provided as well for the curious.<br />As with other books in this series, one does not even have to plan to cook the various recipes in order to benefit from it as the timeless sepia images of rural England can provide a dreamy excursion back to a more innocent age.  But you would be advised to don your apron and prove to yourself that the humble apple is, in fact, a versatile beast.

possible. She studied as a journalist and use her professional views to observe all the negatives and positives of the \\\\\"new Afghanistan\\\\\". Not only readers can find the realty of life and how politics effect men and women, but also she gives us a good portrait of nature and all the natural beauties scattered all around the country. I read this book and finished that with new understanding of Afghanistan which is not very known to westerners. I recommend this book to those, who are looking for a recent source to get to know Afghanistan and Middle East in general.

journey back to English class and trying to find the subtle meanings of the phrase.<br /><br />Duane Ashley Poole has taken a skill and created poetry that the average reader can really enjoy and

I didn't find the poetry long (after all, I have read Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman) since each of them is less than a page long. There is a broad mix of topics from judgement and deceit through happiness. There are many that reference God in a Christian manner. While the ones that are a bit more like advice are very good, I really enjoyed the slightly broader ones like \\\\\"October in my glass\\\\\" and \\\\\"A New Day\\\\\".

            |I'm sorry, but calling Jesus the messiah is as kosher as eating a ham and cheese sandwich on Yom Kippur.  Bringing about world peace, having the world worship the same G-d, and the return of the Jewish diaspora back to the land of Israel were hardly accomplished by who the Christians believe to be the Messiah.  If he truly was Moshiach, then none of these discussions would be taking place.<br /><br />When the Moshiach does come, it will end hatred and intolerance--unlike what happened when Jesus' followers tried to propagate their faith.

long-time friend. I finally got to put the book down yesterday--when I finished it after reading almost nothing else for several days. A year after her beloved grandmother Elsie died, Barb Waite discovered the diary Elsie kept while teaching in Arizona from 1913 to 1916. To her credit, Barb didn't just read the diary and put it away. She looked further, and found newspaper clippings and even some of Elsie's early students from her one year in Cornville. They, after 75 years, still remembered Elsie and told Barb more stories about her.<br /><br />Okay, I'll admit that as a guy Elsie's pretty face on the cover caught my attention, but so did the intelligent, intense look on her face--a sort of \\\\\"Okay, let's get going\\\\\" look. Also, 1916 is mentioned--the year my late father was born. I collect vintage postcards, and the years 1913 to 1916 were during the Golden Age of Postcards--when \\\\\"postals\\\\\" were the emails of that era. Knowing how people lived then helps me appreciate the cards--and their messages--that I have in my collection. I loved Elsie's mother advising her to send \\\\\"postals\\\\\" rather than write letters until her (Elsie's) sore, tired eyes recovered.<br /><br />Elsie wrote only a few lines a day in her diary, but sent and received long, detailed letters. She and her mother kept those letters, and we get to read them here, thanks to the author. Great stuff for anyone interested in life at the beginning of the last century, when \\\\\"creek up\\\\\" meant no delivery of eagerly awaited letters and when cars were still curiosities and travel by horse and train was common. Interest in this book should carry far beyond Arizona. It's a true story of real people living in an era long gone from the U.S., but also a story of love--with its hopes, doubts, fears, and strong emotions--that is repeated, in one way or another, in all of us. This is a wonderful book, andrather than give my copy to my sister, I'll buy her her own.<br /><br />Den Adler, author of \\\\\"To Become a Priest--a Love Story\\\\\"

Oh, it exists. It exists and children's librarians know to fear it. At a certain time of year a child will approach the reference desk and utter the dreaded words, \\\\\"I have to read an autobiography of somebody famous\\\\\". Never mind that while biographies are plentiful, good autobiographies come out once in a blue moon and, when they are written for kids, tend to be about children's authors anyway (See: Jack Gantos, Beverly Cleary, Jerry Spinelli, Walter Dean Myers, Jean Fritz, etc.). If a kid wants somebody famous in a field other than writing, the pickings are slim. You might find a good Ruby Bridges book or [[ASIN:0689867476 To Dance]] by Siena Siegel or that children's autobiography Rosa Parks wrote. Beyond that, you're on your own. It is thereofre with great relief that we come across Chuck Close: Face Book. Sure, I'm relieved that at long last there's an autobiography for kids by someone outside the children's literary sphere, but what really thrills me is the sheer splendor of the thing. Chock full of gorgeous full-color reproductions of Close's work and biographical info, the real treat is at the center of the book. It's a game, it's informative, it's what we all needed but didn't know it yet.<br /><br />Culled from interview questions lobbed at the artist Chuck Close by P.S. 8's 5th grade students, this is a title that is part Q&A, part explanation of artistic techniques, and part flip book. From his earliest days Chuck had the makings of an artist. Which is to say, he was a bedridden kid whose poor health enabled him to draw. His parents encouraged Chuck's desire and though he was not a particularly good student in other areas, in art he thrived. Eventually he was able to cultivate a style entirely of his own, until \\\\\"The Event\\\\\" when he was paralyzed. Yet even after that trauma he was able to continue his art. The children's questions go through Close's life and even allow him to explain his artistic techniques. Backmatter includes a Timeline, Resources, a Glossary, a List of Illustrations and an Index. Curiously the only other children's book about Chuck Close ([[ASIN:0789426587 Chuck Close Up Close]] by Jan Greenberg) is not one of the eight books listed in the Resources section at the back of the book.<br /><br />We talk all the time about role models and how to find them. Chuck Close is probably as close as you can get to a perfect role model in terms of difficulties he has faced. First and foremost there was the nephritis that rendered him bedridden at the age of 11 and gave him plenty of drawing time (he and Andy Warhol have this much in common). Then there was his prosopagnosia or \\\\\"face blindness\\\\\" which kept him from recognizing other people. Add onto that the fact that he got terrible grades (graduating high school without being able to add, subtract or multiply) and then later suffered a collapsed artery in his spine which paralyzed him from the waist down and you basically have a fellow who knows adversity better than most. With all that in mind, the book certainly makes it clear that his success wasn't the result of being some kind of an artistic genius. Over and over again Chuck reiterates that \\\\\"Inspiration is for amateurs. Artists just show up and get to work. Every idea occurs while you are working\\\\\" and later \\\\\"Ease is the enemy of the artist. Go ahead and get yourself into trouble.\\\\\"<br /><br />The book's job was to organize the questions and answers in such a way as to create a kind of narrative. The kids questions tend to be things like \\\\\"Do you work from live models or photographs?\\\\\" and \\\\\"Do others help you make your art?\\\\\" Fortunately someone took the time to find the questions that seem the most biographical and put them at the start. Then she played with them, making \\\\\"How did you become such a great artist?\\\\\" first as a kind of jumping off point for the book and \\\\\"Do you have any advice for young artists?\\\\\" last. The selection of the art and photographs must have taken some timeas well (luckily Chuck was the kind of kid who liked to have interesting pictures taken with monkeys or top hats), and the end product is ultimately vibrant. I was relieved to see that Chuck's most famous self-portrait, the one taken in 1968 of him smoking a cigarette, was included in the book. In an era where cigarettes are airbrushed out of 1940s dust jacket photos (see: Goodnight Moon) it comes as an odd relief to see the past unwhitewashed. And don't worry, oh ye concerned parents. Chuck takes the time to inform the kids that smoking isn't the way to go and that he did it \\\\\"before people knew how bad smoking is for the body\\\\\".<br /><br />You can see why Close is such a perfect artistic subject for children. He only does faces, not nudes or cow corpses cut in half or profanity laden photography. Just faces. Sometimes his subjects don't wear shirts, but since you're only getting their faces anyway it's hardly do or die. School assignments of Mr. Close are therefore inevitable. With that in mind there seems to have been a conscious effort to make this book as enjoyable as possible. A Q&A book with photographs spotted throughout the text could have been easy enough as it was. Dry but easy. I'd love to know whose idea it was to make the center into a flip book of fourteen of Close's portraits. They line-up beautifully against one another. Even if you look at a face that was painted in the early 70s and compare it to one taken in the last few years, because Close is such a master they still line-up. Kids will enjoy the simple rudimentary aspects of the biography but they'll pore over the images in the flip section. For once you can hand them a nonfiction title that's loads of fun.<br /><br />One of the book's strengths is that Close is the perfect subject for kids because he is in a unique position that allows him to teach them about different painting techniques. In the course of the book seventeen different processes are explained to kids. Unfortunately for us, in the interests of time or space Chuck will usually give a rough overview of a process but not explain it in any depth. For example a mention of Close's tapestries simply says that they're woven in Belgium and that Close takes \\\\\"the photographs they are made from\\\\\" and he oversees each step of the process. I'm not quite sure what that means and I'm not sure a kid would either. Fortunately a Glossary at the back does provide a little insight as to what an acid bath or a silkscreen might be. Therefore the book acts as a kind of starting point for kids interested in these techniques. For more information they'll have to seek out other books on their own.<br /><br />Though he doesn't belabor the point, it is clear after reading this book that much of Close's life can be attributed to the plethora of art classes he had access to as a kid. Even though he grew up in what he describes as a poor town, his school still had the time and resources to hand their students art materials. In an age when artistic programs are increasingly cut in the name of testing it's important to see how future artists may only appear where schools foster these programs. Certainly Mr. Close's life is evidence of this. His autobiography is bound to interest budding artists and, thanks to its eclectic formatting, even those kids without a drop of artistic interest in their blood. Though it is only 56 pages this is one title that delivers a wallop. A great way to present an artist. Let us hope that other books will follow in its footsteps even as young artists follow in Mr. Close's.<br /><br />For ages 9-12.as well (luckily Chuck was the kind of kid who liked to have interesting pictures taken with monkeys or top hats), and the end product is ultimately vibrant.
